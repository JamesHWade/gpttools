    OpenAI when making an account. We do not know how secure these are when
    sent to OpenAI, we also do not know what OpenAI does with them. The code is
    designed to ONLY share the highlighted or selected text and no other
    elements of your R environment (i.e. data) unless you have highlighted it
    when running the addin. This may limit usability for now, but I do not want
