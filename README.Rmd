The goal of gpttools is to extend gptstudio for R package developers to
more easily incorporate use of large language models (LLMs) into their
project workflows. These models appear to be a step change in our use of
text for knowledge work, but you should carefully consider ethical
implications of using these models. Ethics of LLMs (also called
[Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)) is an area of
very active discussion.

## Prerequisites

1.  Make an OpenAI account. As of now, the free one will do.

2.  [Create an OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)
    to use `{openai}` package within Rstudio

3.  Set the API key up in Rstudio in one of two ways:

-   By default, functions of `{openai}` will look for `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    environment variable. If you want to set a global environment
    variable, you can use the following command, where `"<APIKEY>"`
    should be replaced with your actual key:

```{r}
#| eval: false
Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "<OPENAI_API_KEY>")
```

-   Alternatively, you can set the key in your .Renviron file.

Otherwise, you can add the key to the .Renviron file of the project. The
following commands will open .Renviron for editing:

```{r}
#| eval: false
require(usethis)
edit_r_environ(scope = "project")
```

You can add the following line to the file (again, replace
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your actual
key):

``` bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

This now set the API key every time you start up this particular
project. Note: If you are using GitHub/Gitlab, do not forget to add
.Renviron to .gitignore!

## Usage

The package has four addins:

-   Comment code: uses code-davinci-edit-001 model from OpenAI to add
    comments to your code with the prompt: "add comments to each line of
    code, explaining what the code does"

-   Add roxygen: uses text-davinci-003 model from OpenAI to add and fill
    out a roxygen skeleton to your highlight code (should be a function)
    wiht the prompt: "insert roxygen skeleton to document this function"

-   Convert script to function: uses code-davinci-edit-001 model from
    OpenAI to convert a highlighted script into a function with the
    prompt: "convert this R code into an R function"

-   A freeform addins that let's you specify the prompt using the "edit"
    functionality of chat-gpt

You can access these addins through the addin toolbar or use the command
pallet: `CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+P`. Examples of each of the addins in action is below.

## Privacy Notice

**Privacy note:** these functions work by taking the text or code you
have highlighted/selected with the cursor and send these to OpenAI as
part of a prompt, they fall under their privacy notice/rules/exceptions
you agreed to with OpenAI when making an account. I do not know how
secure these are when sent to OpenAI, I also don't know what OpenAI does
with them. The code is designed to ONLY share the highlighted/selected
text and no other elements of your R environment (i.e. data) unless you
have highlighted it when running the addin. This may limit usability for
now, but I do not want people to accidentally share sensitive data with
OpenAI.

DO NOT HIGHLIGHT, AND THEREFORE UPLOAD, DATA/CODE/TEXT THAT SHOULD
REMAIN PRIVATE
